                    <p> 1.Brownies Galore - the best chocolate dessert on earth. There is nothing better on this planet in my opinion than a good chocolate brownie. Nothing. Those who say otherwise (unless alergic to chocolate - yes, I knew someone with this allergen!) is a LIAR! What makes the best chocolate brownie? Is it the soft crunch on the top? The lovely and soft chocolate rich middle? Or is it the comaprison between the hotness of a brownie and the coolness of ice-cream when the two are paired together? In my opinon it is all! If it is the soft crunch thats best for you, I point you towards a cookie. If it is just the gooey middle, chocolate fudge cake. Most desserts go well with icecream. So, case and point really!  </p> 
                    <p> 2. Chocolate Mousse- a light, fluffy and smooth rich delicacy. A delightful dish, perfect for the summer. Its chocolate and its cold. Its light so its the perfect ending for a dinner that has *almost* filled you up, but not quiet! There are many ways to enjoy this dessert. Wether its a chocolate and raspberry mousse, chocolate orange or perhaps it is inside a profiterole? Whatever takes your fancy, you best believe that this dessert is just as tasty as a brownie. Personally however, brownies is better hence the second place. </p>
                    <p> 3. Chocolate Cake - a gateau or a red velvet? Another chocolate dessert I know! Similar to brownie, I am aware! But, chocolate cake for me is nostalgic. It was made and prepared for me by someone who was very close to me. I enjoyed looking forward to chocolate cake because I knew I would be seeing the person who made the chocolate cake. Sometimes, there is nothing better than comfort food. It is good for the heart. </p>

                     <h2> Cooking crimes of tastiness </h2>
                     <h3>The tantilisng journey of putting food on the table! - Read Time: 6 minuets </h3>

                    <p> What are some of the best foods that you always want to eat? For me alot of the dinners I look forwards to always feature pasta or rice. The Italians know how to cook food that is for sure. I am nnot a huge fan of seafoods, so however much I may crave a seafood linguini I am sad to say I wouldn't enjoy it. But, any pasta that has a meat base like a good old' ragu spaghetti bolognase I love. Lasagne, is one of my favourites, I love the layers that go into the dish giving it a nice structure. Raviolli is also delish, one of my favourite combiaitions is a spinach and ricotta ravolli. Which is good because who doesn't love veggies and cheese.    </p> 
                    <p>  Asian foods have spectacular flavour ranges, and one genre of dish that I love is curry. There are so many different curries and when I go out to eat at an Indian restaurant I try to make sure I taste a new curry. Some of the curry dishes I love are: Bhunas, Baltis and Masala. Butter chicken I discovered through ticktok, the colour of this dish instantly compelled me to try it. However, I didn't enjoy this dish as much as other ones as for me I found that it was too sweet and too buttery. This may just be the restaurant I had it at though, so I will definately be trying it again! </p>
                    <p> Other rice dishes I enjoy include paella or just simply steamed rice and fish. For me a seafood paella is not my favourite and I will avoid it because of the seafood that typically goes into it. But a vegetable paella is fantastic. The blend of the rice and the vegetables with a side of calamaris make it one of the best holdiay meals to have when one the beachfront. </p>
                    <p> Comfort food for me takes form as a stew, soup, shepards pie or a roast dinner. In the cold and miserable english winters hot warming food, with potatoes on the side (my fave), cannot be beaten! Stew is what i look forward to about winter because its too warming to eat at other times! </p>
